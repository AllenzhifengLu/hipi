      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="section">
	HIPI is a library for Hadoop's MapReduce framework that
	provides an API for performing image processing tasks in a
	distributed computing environment. Here is an overview of our
	system:
	
	<img class="centered_image" src="images/hipi_pipeline.png" width="700" alt=""/>
	
	The input type used in HIPI is referred to as a <a
	href="">HipiImageBundle</a> (HIB). A HIB is a set of images
	combined into one large file along with some metadata
	describing the layout of the images. A HIB can be created from
	an already existing set of images or directly through some
	other source (e.g. our <a href="">DistributedDownloader</a>). <br /><br />

	In order to improve the efficiency of some jobs, HIPI allows a
	user to specify a culling function that discards images that
	do not meet a specified set of criteria (e.g. the image must
	be less than 10 megapixels). The user-specified <a
	href="">CullMapper</a> class is then invoked on each image
	that passes the culling test. Images are presented to this
	class as a <a href="">FloatImage</a> and an associated <a
	href="">ImageHeader</a>. Although HIPI does not directly
	modify any of the default Hadoop MapReduce behavior once the
	Mapper's take over, a user can modify execution parameters
	specific to image processing tasks through the <a
	href="">HipiJob</a> object during setup.  <br /><br />

	Great care has been taken to ensure that the implementations
	of the necessary components of Hadoop MapReduce are efficient
	and effective for image processing tasks. Please see our <a
	href="experiments.html">Experiments</a> section for further
	analysis of HIPI.

      <h2>The Four Main Classes</h2>
      <div class="section">
	The classes most frequently used by a practitioner are the <a
	href="">HipiImageBundle</a>, the <a href="">FloatImage</a>,
	and the <a href="">CullMapper</a> classes. These classes
	provide most of the functionality an average user will need
	and are described briefly below. The full API for HIPI can be
	found on our <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>
	page.
	
	<h3>HIPIImageBundle (HIB)</h3> 
	
	A HIPI Image Bundle (HIB) is a collection of images that are
	stored together in one file, somewhat analagous to .tar files
	in UNIX. HIBs are implemented via the <a
	href="">HipiImageBundle</a> class and can be used directly in
	the Hadoop MapReduce framework. Several common operations can
	be performed on HIBs, including:
	<div class="todo">TODO: Show small code snippets for each of these</div>
	<ul>
	  <li>Create a HIB</li>
	  <li>Add images to an already existing HIB</li>
	  <li>Merge two HIBs</li>
	  <li>Read the images from a HIB (random access is permitted)</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="important">Important Note:</div>
	HIBs must be opened in either FILE_MODE_READ or
	FILE_MODE_WRITE mode (see <a
	href="">AbstractImageBundle::open</a>), and once they have
	been opened in one mode, the mode cannot be switched.  <br
	/><br />

	You can create a HIPI Image Bundle from a set of files using
	the operations listed above, or via some external source
	(e.g. Flickr) via our <a
	href="">DistributedDownloader</a>. Please see the <a
	href="">HIB javadoc page</a> for more details on all of the
	HIB operations, and the <a href="">Experiments</a> page for
	information regarding the design of HIBs.
	
	<h3>Float Image</h3>
	
	Researchers and students most often deal with floating point
	images, and worrying about encoding or decoding various image
	types can be a pain, so we implemented a FloatImage class that
	handles this for the user. We even have added implementation to
	allow variosu image types to be converted to one
	another. FloatImage is stored like a tensor, so images can be
	grayscale, RGB, or have any number of channels to it. We also
	feature common image methods such as crop, and convolution.
	<br /><br />

	Our FloatImage class is presented to users of HIPI in the Map
	phase, where all images from the HIPI Image Bundles are
	sent. This way, floating point images are presented to the user
	without the user having to have any knowledge of the image type
	or where it comes from.
	
	<h3>Cull</h3>
	
	Often when dealing with image sets, you want a way of filtering
	images so that only images with certain properties are
	consider. Applications such as <a
	href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/im2gps/">im2gps</a>,
	for instance, only need to consider images with proper GIS data
	in the image headers and exif data. HIPI provides a Cull class
	that provides an interface for filtering the data. This class is
	passed in through the HipiJob class (described below). In
	addition to saving runtime (images that do not pass the cull are
	not decoded into FloatImages), the culler also makes writing
	applications in the Map class much simpler since users can
	assume that images in the Mapper are only the images which pass
	the filter specified by the culler.

      <h2>HIPI Platforms</h2>
      <div class="section">
	HIPI stands for Hadoop Image Processing Interface because it
	is meant to run on Apache Hadoop. Take a look at our <a
	href="gettingstarted.html"> Getting Started</a> page for
	details on how to install and set up Hadoop. Check out the <a
	href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a> website for
	more details on Hadoop.
      </div>
      
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <div class="section">
	Examples can be found on the <a
	href="examples.html">examples</a> page. We provide several
	examples, including trivial and non-trivial applications of
	HIPI being used on Hadoop's platform.
