        HIPI is an image processing library designed to be used with the <a class="external_link" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop MapReduce</a> parallel programming framework. HIPI facilitates efficient and high-throughput image processing with MapReduce style parallel programs typically executed on a cluster. It provides a solution for how to store a large collection of images on the Hadoop Distributed File System and make them available for efficient distributed processing. HIPI is developed and maintained by a growing number of developers from around the world and has been used in a number of academic and commercial applications.<br /><br />The latest release of HIPI has been tested with Hadoop 2.6.0.
      
      <h3>System Design</h3>

      This diagram shows the organization of a typical MapReduce/HIPI program:<br />

	The primary input object to a HIPI program is a <a href="doc/api/hipi/imagebundle/HipiImageBundle.html">HipiImageBundle</a> (HIB). A HIB is a collection of images represented as a single file on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The HIPI distribution includes <a href="examples.html">several tools</a> for creating HIBs, including a MapReduce program that builds a HIB from a list of images downloaded from the Internet. <br /><br />

	The first processing stage of a HIPI program is a culling step that allows filtering the images in a HIB based on a variety of user-defined conditions like spatial resolution or criteria related to the image metadata. This functionality is achieved through the <a href="doc/api/hipi/imagebundle/mapreduce/CullMapper.html">CullMapper</a> HIPI class. Images that are culled are never fully decoded and decompressed, saving valuable processing time.<br /><br />

	The images that survive the culling stage are assigned to individual map tasks in a way that attempts to maximize data locality, a cornerstone of the Hadoop MapReduce programming model. This functionality is achieved through the <a href="doc/api/hipi/imagebundle/mapreduce/ImageBundleInputFormat.html">ImageBundleInputFormat</a> class. Images are presented to map tasks as a <a href="doc/api/hipi/image/FloatImage.html">FloatImage</a> object with an associated <a href="doc/api/hipi/image/ImageHeader.html">ImageHeader</a> object. The FloatImage class include a number of useful methods like cropping, color conversion, addition, and scaling.<br /><br />

	The records emitted by the map stage are routed to reduce tasks according to the MapReduce shuffle algorithm that attemps to minimize network traffic. Finally, the user-defined reduce tasks are executed in parallel and their output is collected and written to the HDFS.<br /><br />

	The goal of HIPI is to provide easier access to high-throughput and efficient image processing on the MapReduce platform. To this end, we performed a series of <a href="experiments.html">experiments</a> that show HIPI favorably compares to several common alternatives for representing and processing large collections of binary data in MapReduce.
