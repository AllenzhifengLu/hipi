      <h2>General Information</h2>

      <div class="section">
	HIPI is designed to provide a reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use library for performing large-scale distributed image processing tasks within the Hadoop programming framework. HIPI was created by Sean Arietta, Jason Lawrence, Liu Liu, and Chris Sweeney in the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/">Computer Graphics Group</a> at the University of Virginia.
	<br/ ><br />

	The development of HIPI was partially supported by the National Science Foundation through a Cluster Exploratory (CluE) grant IIS-0844416 ("Image Super-Resolution using Trillions of Examples") and with resources generously made available by IBM and Google.
