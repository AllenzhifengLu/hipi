      <h2>General Information</h2>
      <div class="section">
	This work was made possible by the efforts of two
	undergraduate students (Chris Sweeney and Liu Liu), one
	graduate student (Sean Arietta), and one professor (Jason
	Lawrence) at the University of Virginia. The work spawned out
	of research being conducted by Sean Arietta and Jason Lawrence
	on Large-Scale Image Processing. Chris Sweeney and Liu Liu
	joined the team to develop the system into a usable tool for
	practitioners and provide experimental validation for the
	system.<br /><br />

	<strong>This research is supported by the National Science
	Foundation through a Cluster Exploratory (CluE) grant
	IIS-0844416 ("Image Super-Resolution using Trillions of
	Examples") and by resources made available by Google and
	IBM.</strong>

	<h3>The Mission</h3> 
	
	To create a reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use interface for
	performing image processing tasks on the Hadoop MapReduce
	architecture.
